# Operating-System
The purpose of this assignment is to implement a multi-threaded C program that uses a shared bounded buffer to coordinate the production of NxN matrices for consumption in matrix multiplication. For two matrices M1 and M2 to be multiplied, the number of columns of M1 must equal the number of rows of M2. The program will perform parallel work using multiple threads to: (1) produce NxN matrices and place them into a shared buffer, and (2) consume NxN matrices from the bounder buffer for pairing with another matrix for matrix multiplication having a valid number of rows and columns. Matrices consumed from the bounded buffer with an invalid number of elements for multiplication are discarded and the buffer is queried again to obtain a new candidate matrix for multiplication.
